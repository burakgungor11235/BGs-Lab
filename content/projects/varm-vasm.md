varm and vasm represent a deep dive into systems programming, providing a low-level execution environment inspired by ARMv7.

### Key Features
- **Zero Garbage Collection**: Direct memory management for performance and Predictability.
- **Cross-platform Assembly**: Assembly code that runs anywhere C99 is supported.
- **Advanced Concurrency**: Integrated support for both multi-threading and green threading.
- **System Capabilities**: Built-in syscalls, networking primitives, and a comprehensive standard library.

This project demonstrates the ability to reason about hardware-adjacent software and build robust, high-performance systems from scratch.
