89crypt offers a mathematical approach to symmetric encryption distinct from conventional cryptographic algorithms. It leverages repeating decimal expansions to populate key matrices.

### Objective & Achievements
- **Mathematical Innovation**: Uses periodic decimal expansions for matrix-based encryption.
- **Robust Engineering**: Fully type-hinted Python package with modular design and comprehensive documentation.
- **Recognition**: Finalist in the I-MAT Project Competition and TUBITAK 2204-A participant.
- **Open Source**: Published under GPL-3.0 to encourage transparency and collaboration.

The project demonstrates high-level proficiency in software architecture, mathematical modeling, and cryptographic principles.
