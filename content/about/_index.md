I'm preparing to study Elektrotechnik und Informatik at Uni Bremen.

## My Engineering Philosophy

**Belief isn't enough. I have to know.**\
Unless there is a time constraint.\
Then I pray that it works.

Engineering should be grounded in data, not opinions.
Claims without evidence are just that, claims.
Before I accept a "best practice," I want to see the benchmarks,
the edge cases, the trade-offs documented.

Measure everything. Guesswork leads to guesswork, data leads to understanding.

Question conventions. Patterns are useful shorthands, but they calcify quickly. I prefer understanding why something works, not just that it works.

Verify, don’t trust. Documentation lies. Blog posts age poorly.
The only truth is what I can reproduce on my own system with my own workload.

## This Blog

Here I document experiments, share findings, and showcase projects. If I write about something, I've likely benchmarked it, broken it, and rebuilt it. Expect code, data, and the occasional rant about cargo cult programming.

## Technical Interests

- **Low-Level Systems**: C, assembly, operating systems—where software meets silicon
- **AI & ML**: PyTorch, transformers, understanding what neural networks actually learn
- **Performance Optimization**: x86_64, SIMD, cache effects that textbooks ignore
- **Markup**: $\small \LaTeX$, $\small \text{Typst}$, `CommonMark`, XML...

## About My Studies

Preparing for **Elektrotechnik und Informatik** at **Universität Bremen**. Electrical engineering provides the physical foundation; computer science provides the abstraction tools. Together, they let me build systems I actually understand.
